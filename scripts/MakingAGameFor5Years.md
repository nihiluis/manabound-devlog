## Hook
Hey guys, I've been cooking on my game for more than 5 years and now it's time for my first devlog for my game Manalord!

In Manalord you start as a tiny hero in traditional RPG manner. 

You can explore the world of Lorim, become a powerful warrior by killing mobs and banditry, rising to an S-rank adventurer. It's a sandbox game though! So if you want to have it a little more chill, buy yourself a plot of land, grow crops, go fishing, craft and build up your estate. Just like in a farming sim.

So what's the twist? You begin with one hero but eventually you found a dynasty and gather heroes that follow you. As time passes and you go through the seasons and years, your hero will age and a new generation will take over.

## Origin Story
Some years ago, I stumbled upon the open-source Godot engine. I read about it a few times about it, doing nothing.. But at some point I guess I got inspired and just started learning Godot. And this lead me on a 5 year journey whose result you see right now.

At first, I just wanted to learn, have fun. Slowly this evolved to Manalord. My prime nostalgic experience was exploring the world of Golden Sun, a GBA JRPG similar to Final Fantasy 5. Wanting to craft my own fantasy world and replicate that sense of exploration and adventure, I needed a big top-down 2d overworld and classic RPG character progression. 

Instead of a story-rich game, I wanted to build a sandbox world where you can take a variety of skills, grind and have success with it. Every interaction in Lorim should matter. But without a story, this type of world needs more stuff to do and meaning. Just cutting down mobs would not cut it. So I looked to two games I liked a lot: Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley. Housing and an expansive crafting system were the ideal match to combine with the exploration and loot part.

As I got into pixel art, I really liked building maps as well which is why I went beyond the overworld and also added regular maps.

- wanted to combine nostalgia for oldschool JRPGs (shot of Golden Sun travelling by boat), sense of exploration and character progression
- with a wider array of activities that enable emergent roleplay as in Stardew Valley
- and passion for building up land, characters and even dynasties in a large sandbox world in games like Crusader Kings 2 and Europa Universalis 4
- always wanted to create my own world. while i did read some books, i grew up with video games as my ultimate medium to experience narration
  - so this set up my dream, ambition

- picking up skills along the way
- in 2020 (or was it 2019?) I did not know what I was getting myself into

## Vision
### Gameplay loop
- Everything you do makes your character stronger, gives you coin, so you keep on exploring, farming, whatever
- I did not plan this, for fun, emergent
- makes sense to put this later in the video since it emerged later and is still not finished
- but viewer needs to know what to expect, so I'll start with a super basic one I think
- which then gets built up in the Progress section

## Progress
- show shots of each year highlighting the skill development

## What's next
- battle polish
- audio
- demo
