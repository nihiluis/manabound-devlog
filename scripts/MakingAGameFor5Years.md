## Hook
Explore a big sandbox world. Get rich, become powerful, build up your character. Its a sandbox, so why just one character? You can have more and develop every character to your desire

## Origin Story
- wanted to combine nostalgia for oldschool JRPGs (shot of Golden Sun travelling by boat), sense of exploration and character progression
- with a wider array of activities that enable emergent roleplay as in Stardew Valley
- and passion for building up land, characters and even dynasties in a large sandbox world in games like Crusader Kings 2 and Europa Universalis 4
- always wanted to create my own world. while i did read some books, i grew up with video games as my ultimate medium to experience narration
  - so this set up my dream, ambition

- picking up skills along the way
- in 2020 (or was it 2019?) I did not know what I was getting myself into

## Vision
### Gameplay loop
- Everything you do makes your character stronger, gives you coin, so you keep on exploring, farming, whatever
- I did not plan this, for fun, emergent
- makes sense to put this later in the video since it emerged later and is still not finished
- but viewer needs to know what to expect, so I'll start with a super basic one I think
- which then gets built up in the Progress section

## Progress
- show shots of each year highlighting the skill development

## What's next
- battle polish
- audio
- demo
