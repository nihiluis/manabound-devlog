## Hook
Hey guys, I've been cooking on my game for more than 5 years and now it's time for my first devlog for my game Manalord!

In Manalord you start as a tiny hero in traditional RPG manner. 

You can explore the world of Lorim, become a powerful warrior by killing mobs and banditry, rising to an S-rank adventurer. It's a sandbox game though! So if you want to have it a little more chill, buy yourself a plot of land, grow crops, go fishing, craft and finally build up your estate. Just like in a farming sim.

Manalord begins with one character but eventually you can gather heroes that follow you. As time passes and you go through the seasons and years, your hero will age and a new generation will take over. Unless you somehow acquire immortality.

## Origin Story
In my 20s I became a guy who wanted to create something. Being a software dev and gamer in my youth, I stumbled upon the Godot engine. I read about it a few times about it, doing nothing.. But at some point I guess I got inspired and just started learning Godot. And this lead me on a 5 year journey whose result you see right now.

My killer nostalgic game from being a child was Golden Sun. Wanting to craft my own fantasy world and replicate that sense of exploration, I needed a big overworld and classic RPG character progression. 

Since I wanted to build a sandbox world, I needed something to fill my world besides a heavy story. 

So I looked to two games I liked a lot: Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley. 

As I got into pixel art, I really liked building maps as well which is why I went beyond the overworld and also added regular maps.

- wanted to combine nostalgia for oldschool JRPGs (shot of Golden Sun travelling by boat), sense of exploration and character progression
- with a wider array of activities that enable emergent roleplay as in Stardew Valley
- and passion for building up land, characters and even dynasties in a large sandbox world in games like Crusader Kings 2 and Europa Universalis 4
- always wanted to create my own world. while i did read some books, i grew up with video games as my ultimate medium to experience narration
  - so this set up my dream, ambition

- picking up skills along the way
- in 2020 (or was it 2019?) I did not know what I was getting myself into

## Vision
### Gameplay loop
- Everything you do makes your character stronger, gives you coin, so you keep on exploring, farming, whatever
- I did not plan this, for fun, emergent
- makes sense to put this later in the video since it emerged later and is still not finished
- but viewer needs to know what to expect, so I'll start with a super basic one I think
- which then gets built up in the Progress section

## Progress
- show shots of each year highlighting the skill development

## What's next
- battle polish
- audio
- demo
